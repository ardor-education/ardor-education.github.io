        I have taught math and science in middle and high school for 17 years.
        I earned a BA in Music, a BA in Math Education, a graduate certification
        in secondary Math and science education from Central Washington University.
        I then continued my education earning an MBA with a concentration in international
        business from Portland State University where I studied abroad in China, and U.AE.,
        Qatar and Saudi Arabia.   I have worked in private schools, title 1 schools,
         alternative Ed, and mainstream public schools. I have served as a math coach, and
         first year teacher mentor.  I now serve as CEO of Ardor Education. While
         I no longer work in the classroom I believe that once a teacher always a teacher.

        I have been a professional software developer for over a decade. I earned my B.S in Computer Science at
        Washington State University (Go Cougs!), and my M.S. in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
        I have made software with a variety of software and organizational environments. I've worked in companies
        large and small, and projects ranging from F/A-18 Mission Control software to high-scale web services with
        millions of transactions a day.

        I love mathematics and the clarity it brings to understanding the world. Newton > Liebnitz. When I'm not making
        software, I enjoy cycling, homebrewing, playing guitar, and board-gaming.

        Formally educated in Computer Science I have been an IT professional for over a decade. In this field I am
        challenged daily to do things better and quicker and in order to do this I have to always be learning. That is
        one of the things I love the most about what I do, the chance to find out new and interesting things every day.
        As enjoyable as it is to learn new things though, I get the biggest reward out of helping others learn. Whether
        it is working with my mom to teach my son about gardening or volunteering to teach high school kids programming.
        Helping people learn new things and overcome difficulties is an extremely rewarding experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now that I am working with Ardor Education I feel like I am able to teach and learn with the rest of the world.
        I am very excited to be working on products that will help students learn and help teachers teach. Knowing I am
        part of a group that will change the world, and help change education for the better is as rewarding as it gets.
        </p>
