    <strong>Mathematics education can be made better.</strong><br/>Mathematics education is stymied with oppressive

        I have worked in Education for over 15 years teaching Mathematics, Science, and Technology. I established Ardor
        Education, Inc. because I believe that great software in the hands of great teachers will create the top tier
        education system that our children deserve. Mathematics should foster curiosity. Mathematics should be creative
        as well as logical. This is why I do what I do. I want people to love Mathematics. I want people to love
        learning.
        </p>

        I love to play jazz saxophone. It is a rewarding and creative experience. However, I have found that
        software development is probably the most creative activity I have ever done. I firmly believe that the blend of
        creative teaching with creatively designed software is the solution to our education dilemma. I want to create
        a cultural revolution by creating generations of students who love Mathematics. I am very fortunate that I am
        now able to pursue my blended passions of Mathematics, Software, and Education. I am excited to see the future
        that the team here at Ardor will create.

        I have been a professional software developer for over a decade. I earned my M.S in Computer Science at
        Washington State University (Go Cougs!), and my M.S. in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have made software with a variety of software environments and team structures. I've worked in companies
        large and small, and projects ranging from F/A-18 Mission Control software to high-scale web services with
        millions of transactions a day.
        </p>
        <p>
        I love mathematics and the clarity it brings to understanding the world. Newton > Liebnitz. When I'm not making
        software, I enjoy cycling, homebrewing, playing guitar, and board-gaming.

        Formally educated in Computer Science I have been an IT professional for over a decade. In this field I am
        challenged daily to do things better and quicker and in order to do this I have to always be learning. That is
        one of the things I love the most about what I do, the chance to find out new and interesting things every day.
        </p>
        <p>
        As enjoyable as it is to learn new things though, I get the biggest reward out of helping others learn. Whether
        it is working with my mom to teach my son about gardening or volunteering to teach high school kids programming.
        Helping people learn new things and overcome difficulties is an extremely rewarding experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now that I am working with Ardor Education I feel like I am able to teach and learn with the rest of the world.
        I am very excited to be working on products that will help students learn and help teachers teach. Knowing I am
        part of a group that will change the world, and help change education for the better is as rewarding as it gets.
        </p>
