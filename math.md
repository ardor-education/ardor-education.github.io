    <h2>Eliminate learning lag with real time monitoring, correction and support</h2>
    <p>
        Normally student work is reviewed and corrected days after completion
        while new math instruction marches on. Often this results in incomplete
        or incorrect student understanding. Ardor
        provides real time corrective feedback and support alleviating student
        frustration and reinforcing good habits. Real time monitoring helps
        teachers target individual needs fast so students stay on track.
