                    Formally educated in Computer Science I have been an IT professional for over a decade. In this field I am
                    challenged daily to do things better and quicker and in order to do this I have to always be learning.
                    That is one of the things I love the most about what I do, the chance to find out new and interesting things every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As enjoyable as it is to learn new things though, I get the biggest reward out of helping others learn.
                    Whether it is working with my mom to  teach my son about gardening or volunteering to teach high school
                    kids programming.  Helping people learn new things and overcome difficulties is an extremely rewarding experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that I am working with Ardor Education I feel like I am able to teach and learn with the rest of
                    the world. I am very excited to be working on products that will help students learn and help teachers
                    teach.  Knowing I am part of a group that will change the world, and help change education for the
                    better is as rewarding as it gets.
