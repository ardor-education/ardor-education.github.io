                    I have worked in Education for over 15 years teaching Mathematics, Science, and Technology.
                    I established Ardor Education, Inc. because I believe that great software in the hands of great teachers will create
                    the top tier education system that our children deserve. Mathematics should foster curiosity. Mathematics should be
                    creative as well as logical.  This is why I do what I do.  I want people to love Mathematics. I want people to love learning.

                    I love to play jazz saxophone. It is a rewarding and creative experience. However, I have found that software
                    development is probably the most creative activity I have ever done.  I firmly believe that the blend of creative
                    teaching with creatively designed  software is the solution to our  education dilemma. I want to create a cultural
                    revolution by creating generations  of students who love  Mathematics.  I am very fortunate that I am now able to
                    pursue my blended passions of Mathematics, Software, and Education. I am excited to see the future that the
                    team here at Ardor will create.
