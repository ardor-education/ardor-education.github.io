            <strong>Differentiation</strong> is the process of "ensuring that what a student learns, and how the student demonstrates what he or she has learned is a match for that student's readiness level. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A50e6E5bvLM&t=2s"> four ways to differentiate</a>.

          <p>
            Worksheets have a large environmental and financial cost. Worksheet curation is a major time cost; teacher time that is better spent on lesson planning. Worksheet practice often doesn’t match a student's readiness level. It is time to deep-six the worksheet! <a href="https://medium.com/@matthew_thornton/math-classrooms-deep-six-the-worksheet-96354979843">Read more</a>

          <p>
            “The biggest reason differentiation doesn’t work… is the way students are deployed in most of our nation’s classrooms. Toss together students who struggle to learn, along with gifted kids, while adding a few English-language learners and a bunch of academically average students and expect a single teacher to differentiate for each of them. That is a recipe for academic disaster… Such an admixture of students with varying abilities in one classroom causes even the most experienced and conscientious teachers to flinch, as they know the task for reaching each child is an impossible one.”

          <p>
            True differentiated instruction is only possible when the teacher has time to actually sit down and look at how students are progressing. It is only possible when a teacher’s time is not monopolized with daily workflow priorities such as grading papers, photocopying and gathering daily materials. It is only possible when a teacher does not actually have to find or create the actual differentiated practice.
