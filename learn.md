            Worksheets have a large environmental and financial cost. Worksheet curation is a major time cost; teacher time that is better spent on lesson planning. Worksheet practice often doesn’t match a student's readiness level. It is time to deep-six the worksheet!

          <p>
            “The biggest reason differentiation doesn’t work… is the way students are deployed in most of our nation’s classrooms. Toss together students who struggle to learn, along with gifted kids, while adding a few English-language learners and a bunch of academically average students and expect a single teacher to differentiate for each of them. That is a recipe for academic disaster… Such an admixture of students with varying abilities in one classroom causes even the most experienced and conscientious teachers to flinch, as they know the task for reaching each child is an impossible one.” <span class="standard-id"> ~ Petrilli </span>

              Ardor Math can fulfill the vision of a true differentiated classroom.
            </strong>
            True differentiated instruction is only possible when the teacher has time to actually sit down and look at how students are progressing. It is only possible when a teacher’s time is not monopolized with daily workflow priorities such as grading papers, photocopying and gathering daily materials. It is only possible when a teacher does not actually have to find or create the actual differentiated practice.

            Ardor eliminates learning lag by providing real time corrective feedback.
            Individualized feedback adapts to a student's readiness level. For example, at level 1 the feedback includes strong scaffolding such as pictures, and explanatory text. However, at level 4
            the feedback is much more concise and mathematical. Individualized feedback alleviates student frustration and reinforces good practice habits.

          <p>
            When student learning becomes more individualized engagement and depth of learning both increase. When a student practices at their own skill level there is less boredom and frustration. When a teacher can monitor student progress in real time they have the time and flexibility to adjust lesson plans. Teachers are better able to help both struggling and advanced students equally. With Ardor you can eliminate learning lag with personalized
            learning pathways.

          <p>
            Learning lag happens when the pace of the classroom moves too fast or too slow. It happens when a concept that needs review is skipped or when a concept doesn’t need review is taught. It happens when the depth of learning is overwhelmingly complex or overly simple. It happens when a student has an incorrect understanding and now must unlearn what they have learned. These are common problems found in almost every classroom. The culprit is often a broken learning cycle. Ardor Math can help you improve the learning cycle.
