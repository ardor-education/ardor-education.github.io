            Ardor is an adaptive mathematics software built for the mobile devices found in the bring your own device classroom. Have a few classroom iPads but not enough for every student? Don't worry. Ardor Math runs on mobile phones,
            Chromebooks, and Android tablets.

            <strong>Differentiation</strong> is the process of ensuring that what a student learns, and how the student demonstrates what he or she has learned is a match for that student's readiness level. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A50e6E5bvLM&t=2s"> four ways to differentiate</a>:

            Worksheets have a large environmental and financial cost. Worksheet curation is a major time cost; teacher time that is better spent on lesson planning. Worksheet practice often doesn’t match a student's readiness level.

          <p>
            “The biggest reason differentiation doesn’t work… is the way students are deployed in most of our nation’s classrooms. Toss together students who struggle to learn, along with gifted kids, while adding a few English-language learners and a bunch of academically average students and expect a single teacher to differentiate for each of them. That is a recipe for academic disaster… Such an admixture of students with varying abilities in one classroom causes even the most experienced and conscientious teachers to flinch, as they know the task for reaching each child is an impossible one.” ~ Petrilli

          </h2>
          <p>
            True differentiated instruction is only possible when the teacher has time to actually sit down and look at how students are progressing. It is only possible when a teacher’s time is not monopolized with daily workflow priorities such as grading papers, photocopying and gathering daily materials. It is only possible when a teacher does not actually have to find or create the actual differentiated practice.

          <p>
            Learning lag happens when the pace of the classroom moves too fast or too slow. It happens when a teacher skips a concept that needs review or covers a concept doesn’t need review. It happens when the depth of learning is complex and overwhelming or overly simple. It happens when a teacher fails to detect that a student has an incorrect understanding and now that student must unlearn what they have learned. These are common problems found in every classroom. The culprit is often a broken learning cycle. To eliminate learning lag we must improve the learning cycle.

          <p>
            Ardor eliminates learning lag by providing real time corrective feedback
            Feedback adapts to a students readiness level. For example at level 1 the feedback include pictures, text, and strong scaffolding. However, at level 4
            the feedback is much more concise and algebraic. This alleviates student frustration and reinforces good practice habits.

          <p>
            When student learning becomes more individualized engagement and depth of learning both increase. When a student practices at their own skill level there is less boredom and frustration. A teacher will see the results immediately which gives them time and flexibility to adjust lesson plans to help both struggling and advanced students equally. Ardor makes is possible to Eliminate learning lag.

            Consider the following finding by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Teachers work an average of

            </a>.
            But it doesn't have to be that way. Let Ardor Math take care of the math practice so you, the teacher, can spend more time doing the things that matter most.
